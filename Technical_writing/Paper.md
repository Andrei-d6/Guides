# How to Read a Paper Effectively

The following rules are based on this wonderful [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeaD0ZaUJ3Y). <br>
**DO NOT** read the article from beggining to end. Feel free to stop the process at any point.

Phase I (Surveying the paper):

1. Read the **title** and keywords
2. Read the **abstract**
3. Read the **conclusions**

Phase II:

4. Look at the **tables and figures** (including captions)
5. Read the **introduction**
6. Read the **results and discussion**
7. Read the **experimental**
8. (**Optional**) Write some notes (so you don't have to reread the whole paper again)

# How to Write a Paper in a Weekend

The method/aglorithm for writing a paper is based on this wonderful [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UY7sVKJPTMA). <br>

Preliminaries (they don't count for the "weekend" of writing):

- Review notes and renew literature search
- Determine the audience (and purpose of the paper)
- The big picture:
    - resist the temptation to correct/edit
    - the job is to **complete the first draft**

The "ALGORITHM":

1. Just get started (don't procastinate)
2. Create an outlie
    - you probably won't finish the paper in one sitting
    - list the figures and tables (as they may appear in the results and disussion)
3. **DO NOT** write the introduction of the paper (at this point - it is the hardest)
4. Begin with the **Experimental** section (should be the easiest & most familiar)
5. Now write the results and discussion (following the outline)

Now the hard (critical) part begins:

6. Convert the text to **clear**, **concise** and **coherent** English (also make sure that the science is correct)
7. Write the conclusions
8. Write the **Abstract** and **Acknowledgments** after the conclusions
9. Do the **Introduction**
    - Why was the study done? (what was the purpose)
    - Collect the relevant background information (so the reader understands what you did)
10. Produce the **References** for the paper
