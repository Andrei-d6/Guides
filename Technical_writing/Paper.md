# How to Read a Paper Effectively

**DO NOT** read the article from beggining to end. Feel free to stop the process at any point.

Phase I (Surveying the paper):

1. Read the **title** and keywords.
2. Read the **abstract**.
3. Read the **conclusions**.

Phase II:

4. Look at the **tables and figures** (including captions).
5. Read the **introduction**.
6. Read the **results and discussion**.
7. Read the **experimental**.
8. (**Optional**) Write some notes (so you don't have to reread the whole paper again).
