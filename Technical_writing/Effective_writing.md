# The Craft of Writing Effectively

The following "rules" are based on this wonderful [guide](https://youtu.be/vtIzMaLkCaM?si=8OM0uTMC8dKlDL-2). <br>

# Words of wisdom:

> Stop thinking about rules and start thinking about readers. <br><br>
> Who's reading the text and what is its function. <br><br>
> Writing is NOT conveying your ideas to your readers! It is changing their ideas.

What happens when you try to read a text NOT written in the way you seek to read it:

1. You slow down
2. You don't understand
3. You get aggravated
4. You are DONE (you STOP)

Writing needs to be:

- **VALUABLE**
- PERSUASIVE
- Organized
- clear

Writing is about **VALUE**, it is NOT about:

- flow
- important
- new
- original

Introductions should give a quick introduction for why these people (the readers/the community) are wrong.

Help readers understand better something they want to understand well:

- the function of the essay (text)
- "move the conversation foward"

- A good literature review enriches the problem.
- Not "giving background" -> build the problem.
- A "gap" in knowledge assumes that knowledge is bounded.

<br>

- NOT: "tells about what the paper will be about".
- YES: 
  - "this paper will argue for" <br>
  - "tells you what questions you have that this paper will answer"

- Concision is not the number of words on the page; it is how long the reader has to process it.
